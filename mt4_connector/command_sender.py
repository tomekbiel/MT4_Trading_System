MT4 Command Sender - A high-level interface for sending commands to MetaTrader 4.

This module provides the MT4CommandSender class, which extends MT4BaseConnector to provide
convenience methods for sending various trading commands to a MetaTrader 4 terminal.

Example:
    # Create a command sender instance
    sender = MT4CommandSender()
    
    # Send a heartbeat
    sender.send_heartbeat()
    
    # Get account information
    sender.send_get_account_info()
    
    # Request historical data
    sender.send_historical_data('EURUSD', 'M15', '2023.01.01', '2023.01.31')"""

    and provides feedback through the logging system.
    
    The class implements the abstract methods from MT4BaseConnector and adds
    specific command methods for different trading operations.

        This class is designed to be used with the corresponding MQL4 Expert Advisor
