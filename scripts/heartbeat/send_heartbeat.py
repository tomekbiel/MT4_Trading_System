"""
Heartbeat Sender - A utility script for sending heartbeat signals to MT4.

This script establishes a connection to a running MT4 instance and sends a heartbeat
signal to verify the connection is alive. It's useful for monitoring the connection
status between the Python trading system and MetaTrader 4.

Usage:
    python send_heartbeat.py

The script will:
1. Connect to the MT4 Command Sender
2. Send a single heartbeat
3. Wait briefly to ensure delivery
4. Shut down cleanly
